    - `createI18nInstance()` - Factory for creating standalone i18n instances with type safety
    - `createI18nInstancePlugin()` - Factory for creating Vue plugin instances
    - `useI18nApp()` - App-level composable for accessing i18n outside components
- **Fallback Locale Support**
    - Export `fallbackLocales` object with locale fallback chain mappings
    - Automatic fallback chain configuration in helper functions
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**
    - Better console logging with new `createConsoleLogger` utility
    - Improved TypeScript type definitions throughout
    - Cleaner import statements and better code organization

### Changed

- Reorganized generator code into modular components under `src/generation/`

- Enhanced TypeScript configuration and ESLint settings
- Simplified imports and removed redundant code paths

### Removed

- Removed legacy generator code in favor of modular architecture

### Fixed

# Release Notes - v1.0.2

## üéâ vite-plugin-vue-i18n-types v1.0.2

This patch release includes critical bug fixes, improved developer experience, and enhanced test coverage.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fix: Base Locale Message Resolution

- **Fixed** incorrect base locale message assignment that could cause translation fallback issues
- The plugin now correctly resolves base messages from the appropriate locale object
- This ensures proper message inheritance and fallback behavior

### Additional Fixes

- **Fixed** ESLint configuration for test helpers to ensure consistent code quality
- **Fixed** CI/CD artifact upload paths for improved build reliability

## ‚ú® Improvements

### Better Debugging Experience

- **Improved** logging behavior - verbose output is now controlled by the `debug` flag
- Reduces console noise during normal operation while preserving detailed logs when debugging
- The `verbose` option is maintained for backward compatibility but maps to `debug` internally
- Enable with: `debug: true` in your plugin configuration

### Enhanced Development Workflow

- **Added** proper file watching for locale patterns in development server
- The plugin now automatically detects new locale files matching your include/exclude patterns
- Improved hot module replacement for faster development iteration

### More Flexible Imports

- **Added** named export `vitePluginVueI18nTypes` alongside the default export
- **New** dedicated plugin export path for cleaner imports
- You can now import the plugin in multiple ways:
  ```typescript
  // Default import (unchanged)
  import i18nTypes from 'vite-plugin-vue-i18n-types'

  // Named import (new)
  import { vitePluginVueI18nTypes } from 'vite-plugin-vue-i18n-types'

  // Direct plugin import (new)
  import { vitePluginVueI18nTypes } from 'vite-plugin-vue-i18n-types/plugin'
  ```

### Robust File Pattern Matching

- **Added** `fast-glob` as a production dependency for more reliable file globbing
- Improves consistency across different operating systems and environments

## üß™ Test Coverage

- **Added** comprehensive integration tests for development and build modes
- **Added** programmatic API integration tests with full coverage
- **Added** reusable test fixtures and helpers for maintainability
- Test coverage now includes:
    - Type definition regeneration in dev mode
    - WebSocket payload emission for HMR
    - Nested type definition generation
    - Build artifact generation
    - API functionality validation

## üì¶ Dependencies

- Added `fast-glob` as a production dependency for improved file pattern matching

## üí° Migration Guide

This is a backward-compatible patch release with no breaking changes. However, we recommend:

1. **For debugging**: Use `debug: true` instead of `verbose: true` in your configuration (though `verbose` still works)
2. **For imports**: Consider using the new named export for better tree-shaking and clearer intent

## üôè Acknowledgments

Thanks to all contributors who helped identify issues and improve the plugin!
